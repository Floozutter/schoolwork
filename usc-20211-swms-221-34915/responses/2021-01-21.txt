1. How is "common sense" defined by Culler?
Culler defines "common sense" using 3 examples:
    1. meaning = intention
    2. writing reflects a truth separate from the text
    3. reality != appearance

2. After reading this article, what is your understanding of "theory"?
From Culler, I interpret "theory" as a claim that is useful as a framework to form insights about a topic. Foucault's theory helps us understand how discourse informs notions of sexuality by claiming a causal history; Derrida's theory helps us evaluate Rousseau's work by claiming an underlying structure.

3. How does the idea of "unmasterability" play into all of this?
It's endless! (Maybe because there's no limit to useful interpretations of anything?)

4. What is one question you have from this article?
Why does Culler emphasize theory as "interdisciplinary"? The overall argument seems more cohesive without this point.
