# Thesis and Topic Statements
## Specific Microaggression
"You're so good looking for a trans person!"

## Thesis Statement
The use of such appearance-related microaggressions intended as compliments is
damaging toward transgender mental health by reinforcing a cisnormative beauty
standard that cultivates transphobia.

## Topic Statements
1. These microaggressions implicitly use the notion of a shared objective
standard for physical attractiveness, strengthening its predominance.

2. Beauty standards cultivate transphobia, because the validity of transgender
people is often questioned on the basis of appearance. (How well they
conform.)
[See: "Passing", avoiding being "clocked", etc.]

3. This transphobia can be internalized due to the covert nature of
microaggressions. (Especially since these microaggressions masquerade as
compliments.)

4. The microaggression is especially harmful because it implies that
transgender people are generally less attractive than cisgender people,
compounding to the emotional struggle for validity.
