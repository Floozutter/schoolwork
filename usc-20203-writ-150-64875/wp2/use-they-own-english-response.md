# Response to "Should Writers Use They Own English?" by Vershawn Ashanti Young
## Explanation of "Code Meshing"
code meshing is when you take like multiple forms of language (yeah im not
gonna even try and define what a "form of language" is here lets leave that up
to interpretation lol) and blend em together for a single use case. the move
lets ya steal language tech like rhetorical devices from one context to
another which, honestly, is prolly optimal in a lot of cases. the
communication meta's gonna be in shambles once they find this exploit lol.

but genuinely though, normalize code meshing it's awesome.

## Languages I Speak
1. English
2. Korean (badly)
3. Netspeak (yuck lol)
4. Python, and other programming languages
5. "Chat-room lingo" (Backup Potion dialect)
