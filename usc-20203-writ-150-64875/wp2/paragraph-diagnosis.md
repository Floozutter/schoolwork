# Paragraph Diagnosis
## Thesis Statement
The concept of white privilege is a useful framework to analyze Robert
Julian-Borchak Williams's arrest by the Detroit State Police Department and,
more generally, the problem of racial bias in machine learning systems as a
whole because both are rooted in the ignorance for systemic factors of racism.

## Body Paragraph
Racial bias is a real, known problem in the field of algorithmic facial
recognition. For example, the paper "An other-race effect for face recognition
algorithms" has shown that face recognition algorithms can be biased toward
one race over another (in terms of accuracy) back since 2011. By comparing the
performance of algorithms developed in Western countries by those developed in
East Asian countries, the paper was able to conclude that "state-of-the-art
face recognition algorithms, like humans, struggle with 'other-race face'
recognition". It has been nine years since then, and the problem has yet to be
resolved. Concerns have only grown about racial bias in face recognition with
articles such as "Facial-Recognition Software Might Have a Racial Bias
Problem", published in 2016, and the National Institude of Standards and
Technology (NIST)'s 2019 study, "Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) Part 3:
Demographic Effects", which confirms the "existence of demographic
differentials in the majority of the face recognition algorithms [they]
studied". Overall, it can be concluded that addressing racial bias for face
recognition is nontrivial and still unsolved.
