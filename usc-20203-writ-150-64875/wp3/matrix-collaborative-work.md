# Collaborative Work on *The Matrix*
## 5 Observations (12:00 ~ 52:00)
1. Imagery of strict structure and hierarchy: corporate/office environment,
encounter with Neo’s boss.
2. Agents interrogate Neo about his double life. Constrained self vs true
self. Boss and Agent Smith use the name “Anderson”, whereas the Resistance
use “Neo”.
3. Implanting the bug intrudes on bodily autonomy. Surveillance and control is
invasive.
4. Morpheus tells Neo that he should be able to “feel” that everything is a
lie. Learning the truth is swallowing a pill, choosing to deny it is
swallowing a pill. Knowledge is visceral.
5. The apocalypse already happened, but only the Resistance knows.

## 200-Word Interpretation (w.r.t. Gender)
Neo's journey in *The Matrix* works really well as an allegory for the
experience of transitioning gender in an oppressive and exclusionary society.
Of course, this perspective was motivated by the fact that Lana and Lilly
Wachowski (the directors of *The Matrix*) are both trans women, but I think
the symbolism can stand fairly strongly with just the content of the film
alone: The way that Neo initially lives out two different lives within
the Matrix where one life is accepted by the system but Neo can't bear to live
it and the other life is criminal yet represents Neo's true self, the way that
Agent Smith adamantly sticks to addressing Neo by his old name "Mr. Anderson",
the way that Neo is forced to choose between living within the system
unhappily or breaking free from it to actualize his ideal self, the way that
knowing the truth about your relation to the Matrix is facilitated by
consuming a pill, the way that the connection between your personal experience
and the outside reality is constantly emphasized throughout the film, and
more... It all fits snugly!
