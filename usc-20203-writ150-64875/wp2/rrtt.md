**Reading:**
"Admitting that white privilege helps you is really just congratulating
yourself" by Fredrik DeBoer, Washington Post (2016-01-28)

**Tweets:**
> The way that DeBoer frames the problem here seems off to me. Instead of
admonishing the people who perform this kind of self-indictment, why not just
encourage them to help make material change alongside continuing the
discourse? (1/4)

> "...The self-indictment involved in claiming white privilege, by failing to
do anything materially to eliminate white privilege, is a farce." This feels
totally overblown. Acknowledging systemic racial inequality exists is a
necessary first step. (2/4)

> It's not like discussion and praxis are inherently in opposition. Talking
about the problem is important to justify the praxis in the first place. The
tone of the article feels unnecessarily hostile; why push away those who could
be allies? (3/4)

> I don't mind the message that there's too much attention focused on the
personal narratives of white privilege (and not enough for the campaigns that
seek to make actual systemic change), but the attitude should be constructive,
not destructive. (4/4)
