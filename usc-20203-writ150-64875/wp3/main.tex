	{Subverting Structures in \textit{Snowpiercer}}


\textit{Snowpiercer} is a film with a grim outlook for humanity. In its
premise, the impending consequences of global warming due to climate change
have come so irrefutably dire that a global-scale climate engineering project
was used to cool down the Earth's surface. This inadvertently plunged humanity
into an ice age where its remaining survivors must weather the cold in a
perpetually-running train named the Snowpiercer. Within the Snowpiercer,
society was structured into a class system by section, where the few at the
front section are able to enjoy the train's many technological luxuries, while
the majority at the tail are coerced into privation by armed guards.
