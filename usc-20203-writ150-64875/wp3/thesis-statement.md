# Thesis Statement
In *Snowpiercer*, the central conflict is resolved by the protagonists
breaking free from the train's class hierarchy, rather than restructuring the
hierarchy from within. In doing so, the film uses its overall theme of class
struggle alongside its subversive narrative structure to critique the notion
that unjust hierarchies can be fixed from within their systems. Through this
critique, *Snowpiercer* advocates for a revolutionary solution to the problems
of capitalism.
