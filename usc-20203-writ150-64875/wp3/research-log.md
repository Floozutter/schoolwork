# Research Log
Find at least five sources that might be helpful to you in Writing Project 3
(two of which must be scholarly). For each source, identify the title and
author, the name of the publication in which the source appears, the database
(if any) that you used to find the source, and the type of source. Then
identity which conversation (of the two that you’re researching) this source
belongs to and describe how this source might be helpful to you in your essay.
(For example, does the article offer an argument about your film that agrees
with your own ideas? Does it present an argument about your film you’d like to
disagree with? Does it describe contemporary social attitudes about race to
which your TV episode is responding?)

## Source 1
- Title and Author: "Not All are Abroad: Decolonizing Exodus in Joon-ho Bong's Snowpiercer" by Lee Fred; Manicastri, Steven
- Database: [USC Libraries](https://uosc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01USC_INST/273cgt/cdi_crossref_primary_10_1080_07393148_2018_1449405)
- Type of Source: Article
- Conversation: Ecological, global, leftist perspective on *Snowpiercer*.
- Utility: Explores an ecological and global perspective alongside the topic of class, which I haven't been considering thoroughly as of yet. Since late capitalism and human-caused environmental degradation are so closely related, I think finding this article opened up a valuable avenue of discussion for me.

- Conversation: Also ecological and leftist.
