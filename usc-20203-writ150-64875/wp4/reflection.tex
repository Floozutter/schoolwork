Writing is stressful. There's just something so beautifully nerve-wracking
about having to pour out a part of your soul into text on a page. You think
about the words you're putting down, you think about how those words reflect
on you as a writer, you think about your goals, your life, your self, and then
you stop writing because your brain's overheated from thinking too much and
you have to take a break. It can be utterly draining to work through a
productive writing session, which is sort of a problem when you have a
semester's worth of essays to get done.
